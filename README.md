# Intro to Machine Learning
The following repo contains @psrth's intro to ML projects. This repo will start off with the ACM recruitment tasks for ML/AI, but the idea is to implement all kinds of models by the end of my learning period.


## 1. K-Nearest Neighbour — MNIST Dataset
The ```knn-mnist.ipynb``` is a Jupyter Notebook with my implementation of a custom K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to solve the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It uses the **numpy** library to handle computational stuff, but I have refrained from using either **sci-kit learn** or **panda.** 

For a value of ```k = 3```, the algorithm performed as follows:

You can find this project on a **Google Colab** notebook [here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C4NPNzLrBHv2VXo3STBdyJ9W-sCnOUCX?usp=sharing)


## 2. SVM — MNIST Dataset


## 3. 2-Layered Neural Net — MNIST Dataset
